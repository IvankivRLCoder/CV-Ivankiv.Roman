Read the text.</h4>                    <p class="about-p">Don’t want to speak a lot, but I want you to realize what a one I am. Lets’ probably start with the fact, that since I can remember myself I’ve always been trying to get margin from something. My experience began from simple market selling of various useless things in my childhood. After I occupied merchandising position. But I was always struggling for more – I became a sales manager. Desired to achieve bigger goal – I became one of the youngest team leads of the transnational corporation. I created my team by myself and successfully performed my responsibilities. But that was not the end – I took a position of sales manager in the monopolist corporation dealing with tobacco of the 4 most famous manufacturers. Having worked on the occupied position, I’ve got that I desired more, however, to achieve this target I must have additional skills for which I can, nothing else, but study. That’s why, I made a decision to flop from a seller to IT specialist. It might have been more lyric if that way was smoother, but I’ve chosen a hard-core way for myself. Having a wife on the maternity leave and a 4-months kid, I left ‘Olympus top’ in the distributing area with no serious reason. Everyone around and I myself were taken aback. However, this is my final goal: to make my mind taken aback, cause in such conditions my brain’s working more effectively. So, what do I have now: a target to get hired to a Junior FrontEnd Developer not later than in 6 month after leaving ex-position, as my savings are limited for this period of time. Currently it’s a 5th month of my battle. Studying demands the highest concentration and persistence. I’m working not less than 10 hours per day, because my early morning codings usually last for days. Working hard on maximum I achieve good results I’m in contemplation of the final of this funny story and the new beginning. Hope the continuation of this story, if you feel interested, I can tell you face to face. Grateful for spending so valuable few minutes from your time to read this all.                    <br/>                    <md-button class="sm-item-skill" ng-click="openOffscreen5()">Українською</md-button>                    </p>                </md-card-content>            </md-card>        </div>        <div layout="row" layout-align="center center" layout-wrap class="wring">            <h3 class="warn" layout-align="center center">I positioned itself as a Front End developer, but I have great passion for creating something beautiful.</h3></div>        <md-content>            <div class="experience" layout="column" layout-gt-xs="row">                <md-card class="education" flex layout-align="center center">                    <md-card-content>                        <h2 class="h-contatent">Education</h2>                        <p class="about-p">In 2016 Web UI Developer.                            <br/>Learning the most popular at last time language - JavaScript, frameworks like jQuery, AngularJS,                            <br/>ReactJS, NodeJS librires and tools for front-end development, and how productively work in a team.                            <br/>                            <br/>2009-2014                            <br/>In 2014 completed the full course of Ivan Franko National University of Lviv                            <br/>and obtained complete higher education in the "Management of Organizations and Administration"                            <br/>and obtained qualification of Specialist in Management of Organizations and Administration,                            <br/>Menager-Economist.                            <br/>                            <br/>                        </p>                        <h4 class="h-contatent">Additional learning experience:</h4>                        <h5 class="h-contatent">Independent Coursework</h5>                        <p class="about-p">- Angular-Material training                            <br/>                        </p>                        <h5 class="h-contatent">Megapolis Ukraine</h5>                        <p class="about-p">- Steps of sales manager.                            <br/>- Improving the skills of finding customer.                            <br/>- Improving communication skills with Improving communication skills with customer.                            <br/>                        </p>                        <h5 class="h-contatent">S.Group</h5>                        <p class="about-p">- The philosophy and practice of tangible and intangible incentives for staff.                            <br/>                        </p>                        <h5 class="h-contatent">Economics Faculty of Ivan Franko National University of L’viv</h5>                        <p class="about-p">- Improving skills in the ability to organize your time and the time for his team.                            <br/>                        </p>                    </md-card-content>                </md-card>                <md-card class="education" flex  layout="row">                    <md-card-content flex layout-align="center center">                        <h2 class="h-contatent">Practical Projects</h2>                        <h4 class="h-contatent">AngelHack 'TOLOKA' - 06.2016</h4>                        <p class="about-p">                            You use LinkedIn to find a job, Twitter to spread the news, and Facebook to connect with friends, but where can you post about and find volunteer work in today’s social networking era? We try to solve this problem.                            We believe, that our project help to increase volunteering worldwide by developing software and a social network that helps nonprofits, communities, and volunteers manage and promote their efforts.                            Our audience was to target the people that don’t volunteer as much because they see it as a super serious thing that will suck up all their time.                            My role in this project is to create and develop page using materializecss and Java Script.
